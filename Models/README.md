# Models
**AY23/24 SEM1 ZB4171 Project - Guzhen**

Data was obtained from the Kaggle competition 'Open Problems - Single Cell Perturbations' which can be accessed at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/open-problems-single-cell-perturbations/overview

Models were tuned through Keras Tuner.

Files required for tuning and training are in Models/Files_Required. Include files in same directory when retraining models. Due to the stochastic tuning of Keras Tuner, different hyperparameters may be achieved with each tuning of the model.

Model 0: One-Hot Encoded Compounds

Model 1: Incoporation of Protein Affinities

Model 2: Experimented with Keras Tuner. Model not saved and cannot be opened.

Model 3: Tuned with Keras Tuner. Retrained with loss function Mean Absolute Error.

Model 4: Tuned with Keras Tuner. Retrained with loss function Mean Absolute Error.

Model 5: Tuned with Keras Tuner. Retrained with loss function Mean Absolute Error.

Model 6: Tuned with Keras Tuner with loss function Mean Absolute Error.
